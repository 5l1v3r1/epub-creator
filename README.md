## ePub Creator is a WebExtension that creates ePub e-books from web pages. Currently it only works on  `overdrive.com`s online reader.

# How to Build

  - `git clone https://github.com/NiklasGollenstede/epub-creator && cd epub-creator`
  - `npm install`
  - `node build.js`<br>
    and temporary load from the `./build/` directory, use the `.zip` file therein<br>
    or `node build.js {run:1}` to debug in a new Firefox instance.
